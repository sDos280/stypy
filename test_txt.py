# The following line uses the print function to output a string to the console.
# The print function takes one or more arguments and outputs them to the console.
# In this case, we're passing a single string argument: "Hello, World!".
# The string is surrounded by quotes, which tell Python that this is a string literal.
# You can use either single quotes (') or double quotes (") to define a string in Python.
print("Hello, World!")
